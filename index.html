                    Narendra Nath Datta
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India. He was
                    more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great orator and passionate patriot. He
                    carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new
                    paradigm. He worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude of the poor and
                    needy, dedicating his all for his country. He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism
                    and established Hinduism as a revered religion on world stage. His message of universal brotherhood
                    and self-awakening remains relevant especially in the current backdrop of widespread political
                    turmoil around the world. The young monk and his teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his
                    words have become goals of self-improvement especially for the youth of the country. For this very
                    reason, his birthday, January 12, is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India.
